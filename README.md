# Craftmine Dailies

Every good rogue-like needs dailiy runs (dailies). 

That's why this mod adds dailies to Minecraft's 25w14craftmine snapshot (for April's Fools 2025). 

## Gameplay

You only have one randomly generated mine per day, which is the same for everyone.

Run starts with a set of forced world ingredients, unlocked world ingredients, (sometimes) a set of forced player unlocks, and a bit of XP.

Collect as many levels in your **INVENTORY** (XP orbs/Kills DO NOT count!) and go to the mine exit **within 30 MINUTES**.

### Good to know: 
- If you die or if timer runs out your XP is **divided by two**.
- World Effects with multipliers count **only if you exit the mine**.
- Once you enter the mine, you can not leave the world (or your progress will not be saved).
